# 👋 Hi, I'm saam — Bitcoin Developer

I’m a Bitcoin developer focused on building non-custodial Lightning solutions using Rust and Flutter. My mission is to empower users to manage their own funds, run their own nodes, and connect any wallet they choose — without relying on custodians or intermediaries.


## 🔧 What I’m Working On

- **Lightning Node Manager (Rust + Flutter)**  
  A cross-platform desktop and mobile app (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android) for managing Lightning nodes and channels in a fully non-custodial way. Inspired by Lightning Terminal (LND), but with the user in complete control of their funds.  

- **Exploring Nostr & Bots**  
  Building bots and automation tools on the Nostr protocol, supporting decentralized identity and secure messaging for Bitcoin users.

- 🦀 Rust backend development  
- 📱 Cross-platform app development (Flutter + Rust)
